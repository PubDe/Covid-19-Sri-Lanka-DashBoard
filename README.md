# COVID-19 Dashboard - Sri Lanka

The COVID-19 Dashboard for Sri Lanka is a comprehensive and dynamic visualization tool that focuses on providing accurate and accessible insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Overview

This repository contains a COVID-19 dashboard focused on tracking and visualizing data related to the pandemic in Sri Lanka. The dashboard is built using PowerBI and provides insights into new cases, deaths, monthly trends, and regional statistics.

## Background

The global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected societies, including Sri Lanka. As part of efforts to provide comprehensive information and insights, a dashboard was developed using PowerBI to visualize COVID-19 data for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. This dashboard encompasses official daily counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths, offering a detailed and dynamic representation of the pandemic's progression in Sri Lanka. Recognizing the significance of up-to-date and accurate information, the dashboard serves as a valuable resource for data visualization, dissemination, and exploration.

## Problem Statement

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of accurate and accessible data for informed decision-making. In the context of Sri Lanka, there is a need for a comprehensive and visually intuitive dashboard that focuses specifically on COVID-19 deaths and cases. The existing challenges include fragmented data sources, a lack of centralized information, and the necessity for a dynamic tool that can adapt to evolving circumstances. To address these issues, the objective is to design and implement a robust COVID-19 Dashboard for Sri Lanka, concentrating on deaths and cases, to serve as a centralized resource for health professionals, policymakers, and the public.
